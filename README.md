# othello

<p>This is an implementation of the board game othello. Othello, also known as Reversi, is a two-player strategy board game. The game board consists of an 8x8 grid of squares, with each square colored either black or white.

The goal of the game is to have the most pieces of your color on the board at the end of the game. The game starts with four pieces placed in the center of the board, two white and two black.

On each turn, a player places one piece of their color on the board, with the condition that the piece must be placed so that one or more of the opponent's pieces are trapped between the new piece and another piece of the same color. These trapped pieces are then flipped to the player's color.

The game ends when there are no more legal moves for either player. The player with the most pieces of their color on the board at the end of the game wins.

Overall, the game is a combination of strategy, planning, and foresight. Good luck and have fun!</p>
